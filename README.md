  <em>
    I am a passionate Front-End Developer focused on creating clean, modern, and interactive UIs.  
    I enjoy transforming ideas and designs into functional and visually appealing digital environments using  
    <strong>React, Next.js, Angular, TypeScript, and CSS/SCSS/TailwindCSS</strong>.  
    I always pay attention to UI/UX, accessibility, component structure, and writing code that is easy to understand and read.  
    For me, a problem-solving mentality is a top priority — I’m not afraid to make mistakes, constantly improve,  
    and learn new things. My goal has always been and will be to create and develop a high-quality product.
