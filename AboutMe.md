👋 Hi there! I'm Nika, a second-year student passionate about web development and design. With hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, I enjoy building responsive and dynamic web applications. I also dabble in SQL for database management. Additionally, I am a team member of a newly established startup company based in Tbilisi, Georgia, named "გარგარი • GarGari," where I work on the Front End. You can find the company's profile in my social links.

🖌️ When I'm not coding, you can find me working in Illustrator, Photoshop, and Figma, crafting engaging designs and user interfaces. My goal is to seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetics.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into PHP to broaden my backend development skills and enhance my full-stack capabilities.

🚀 I'm always excited to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects. Let's build something amazing together!
